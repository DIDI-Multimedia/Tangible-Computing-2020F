The most surprising thing I learned was that, despite having a comparatively simple syntax, how powerful a language javascript is. It has libraries that can enable a developer to tap into the potential of all the accessories and features of a laptop. Once you have a firm grasp of a library, the possibilities are only limited by the computation power of the device compiling the script. 

Based on the feedback I got, I would focus more on the research phase of my project and find elements of synthwave which can be feasibly incorporated into my project. While I was able to incorporate the basic elements such as using contrasting neon colors and a grid, I was unable to make the music visualizer unique and detailed. Detailed in the sense that I failed to incorporate enough elements of synthwave in my design. I only used 3 of the available 10. In the coming phase, I would incorporate other features of my aesthetic as well. I also need to make it unique and distinguishable from the thousands of synthwave examples available online. 

 The biggest barrier stopping me from achieving my goal in this course is my inability to split time between my projects and not be focused on a single project for days. I also need to take more feedback from the professor in order to make sure that all the different parts of the project are connected to each other and perfectly balanced. Technical proficiency and conceptual rigor should be connected to each other and I often too focused on one aspect only. </div>
