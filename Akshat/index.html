            <p> Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My name is Akshat Saraswat; I hail from India. I am currently studying at DIDI (Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation) to become a product designer.
               I am taking the product and multimedia stream here because they appeal the most to my coder 
              like sensibilities.
               I have been coding for 5 years when I decided that I wanted to make a calculator application which I was only able to do after 2 months of learning c/c++/java. 
              Since then, I've taken a keen interest in different programming languages and have tried to study and experiment with python, c#, and other OOL (Object-oriented Languages).
               Lately, I have tried my hand on machine learning libraries namely Keras and TensorFlow. 
              In terms of professional goals, I haven't pinpointed exactly what I want to do in the future and I guess I will use the opportunities that present themselves.
             </p>
