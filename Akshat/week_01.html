            <p>  What are your goals for the course?<br>
                I have always been better at the Back end aspect of coding than the front-end aspect. While I can solve problems related to SQL and server management to a satisfactory level, the place where I always fail is to provide a smooth and understandable User Experience. I want to learn how to provide an exceptional User Experience because as Steve Jobs said in his biography "Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves."
                Without an exceptional customer experience even the best products will not be adopted into daily life.<br><br>
                
                 Is there a "big idea" you hope to explore? <br>
                Something which I find striking is how the consumers as a whole have given in to the idea that big-tech has taken control over our lives. I believe that we can develop counter-intelligence machine learning algorithm which can break the patterns of behaviors that consumers have accepted as a daily part of their life. This will hopefuly break the pattern of coping for dopamine withdrawls by opening social-media etc.<br><br>
                
                 Is there a topic you have encountered at DIDI or another school you want to learn better?<br>
                I have tried to learn machine learning from various sources and would like to study that methodically. However, my main goal is improving the User-Experience which I can provide to the users of the products that i design.<br><br>
                
                 What is your biggest fear of this course?<br>
                My biggest fear in this course are not being able to understand the coding methods being taught to us in a methodical way(in my head) which will make me forget the details. <br> <br>  </p>
