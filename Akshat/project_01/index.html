        <h1>Synth-Fresh-Wave</h1>
        <p>I chose this aesthetic because the forced Perspective draws in the people in. This seperates synthwave from similar aesthetics such as cyberpunk and vaporwave which rely on their colors to convay emotions.   
                <br><br>
           How do you identify what it is and isn't?<br><br>
           Neon colors, colored suns and grids. These are the elements which are present in synthwave. In freshwave there is a subject in the image. Either the subject or the background will be distorted and in wavy lines which seperate the RGB components of the subject. It is called freshwave by its creator and came into being in 2017 when the creator decided to take elements of synthwave and freshwave and blend then in a way that put the focus on the subject. This style also either distorts the background beyond recognition or removes it entirely.</p>

            <h1>Music Visualizers</h1>
             <p>Music visualizers were invented in 1976 by Robert Brown, the man behind the Pong game, who worked at Atari, for the Atari Video Music. It received a mild to positive coverage in Video Magazine. The drawback being that it would become monotonous once the novelty wears off.
                 Music Visualizers only became available in home computers in 1985 when Infinite Softwares released 'sound to light'generator. Multiple versions came to the marketplace in the late 90s and their use became wide-stream once Microsoft implemented them in Windows 97.
                
                
                The main player in this field is Adobe, which, through the After Effects product of the adobe suite, has given even amateurs the ability to create visuals to accompany a song. 
                Frequency-based Music Visualizers chops the audio file into small subsets, usually less than 20 milliseconds, extracts the frequency component, then updates the display according to its value.
                This approach, however, doesn't account for the spikes in the music and fails to recognize the beat and percussion.
                
                These would be the features in my own Music Visualization Tool-
                A landscape with the side view of a lamborghini which is leaving neon trails which will move in a wavelength type formation in accordance with the treble. 
                A neon sun which brightens, changes shapes, emits rays, in accordance with the beat.
                A few palm trees on either end which will also move in accordance with the notes of the music.

            <h1>Future Direction</h1>
            <p>I looked at the star tracking apps. I realized just how much more powerful the dot in the sky becomes when your phone amplyfies its properties and makes makes it rotate and even shows its path in context to the earth.
               So, I thought that what if when you are listening to music in your room, there is sun throbbing in the middle of your room? or a plam tree next to your couch, just lit up in bright neon colors? 
               Or just a grid on your whole floor jumping to a singer's notes? I really think that sitting in the middle of this grid would take it to the next level.
