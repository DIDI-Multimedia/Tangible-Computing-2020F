     <h1>Synth-Fresh-Wave</h1>
     <p>I chose this aesthetic because I am familiar with it.   
             <br><br>
        How do you identify what it is and isn't?<br><br>
        The aesthetic I chose is a subset of the Synthwave aesthetic. It is called freshwave by its creator and came into being in 2017 when the creator decided to take elements of synthwave and freshwave and blend then in a way that put the focus on the subject. This style also either distorts the background beyond recognition or removes it entirely.</p>
