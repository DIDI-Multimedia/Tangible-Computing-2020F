          <p style=" padding: 30px ; color: white; font-size:18px " >After presenting project 1, I received a lot of good feedback. I was able to make the audience feel that they are in cyberpunk filter, by the colors and the font I used. Moreover, the soundtrack made them live the experience being in the future. While doing this project I learned a lot about the power of java script especially when I started to combine other libraries like m5.js. based on the feedback I got from the jury last session, I may change some minor things to make the filter more interactable. Additionally, I would like to make my project one page on my website clearer regarding the font, so the long paragraphs can be easier to read.  One of the question was directed to me at the end of the presentation is “where do you see this project in the future ?”, at that time I didn’t have a clear vision on what I will do next but I was sure that it can be improved in a way. Although this pandemic (Covid-19) made it harder to communicate and ask for help, we were able to achieve and learn a lot. </p>
