  <div class="c1"> 
	<p> In this piece I will be discussing artist and pieces I take inspiration<br> 
		 from, starting with Takashi Murakami, a Japanese contemporary artist, <br>
		 who introduced Super-flat art and is known for mixing modernism with <br>
		 traditional art, where he takes major inspiration from Andy Warhol s <br> 
		 works, he is also the artist behind many famous digital pieces<br> 
		 which include; Kanye West s 2007 Graduation album, Billie Eillish s <br> 
		 you should see me in a crown music video, Louis Vuitton s LV <br>
		 multi-colour monogram bags, and many more... Takashi Murakami was <br>
		 one of the artists which inspired me to start a career in Multimedia, <br>
		 because I really loved his anime-inspired pieces. <br> 
		<br>
		Another Artist who I take inspiration from is Kaws, who started as a <br>
		graffiti artist, he is most commonly known for his skull like pieces <br>
		and has worked with major brands which include, Dior, Uniqlo, Kanye <br>
		West, Nike, and etc.. I found his work appealing to me because he has <br>
		his own unique touch which makes his works instantly recognizable and <br>
		I loved the way he would find any character or already existing figure <br>
		and using his artistic method would change the way the head of the <br>
		character looked like to mark his statement and create this piece of <br>
		art, I believe that his approach and style is unique and sparks <br>
		intrigue with the viewer because his art pieces are a reflection to the<br>
		 undead I believe and he has such a dark take on these characters but <br>
		 portrays them in a very interesting way, like his dead mickey piece <br>
		 which most people are familiar with.
		 <br>
		 Art is subjective, every person views the beauty of art in their own <br>
		 unique way and in my own opinion I believe that these are some of the <br>
		 artists that have truly inspired me to take on this career path and <br>
		 create cartoon inspired digital pieces with my own unique touch.
