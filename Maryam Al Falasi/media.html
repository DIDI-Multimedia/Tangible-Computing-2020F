		<p class="text-block11" > The webcam was first invented in 1991, at Cambridge University by computer scientist Quentin Stafford-Fraser, he created it because he was annoyed that the coffee cup would always run out so he set up a camera and wired it to the computing staff network to check the coffee levels, thus creating the first webcam, and the first time augmented reality, was created, was in 1968 in Harvard, by Ivan Sutherland. The main players in the field of AR and webcam filters include; Microsoft, Snapchat, Instagram, Apple, Sony, Magic Leap and etc… The technological developments that makes this possible, are augmented, visual, and mixed realities, API (Application Programming Interface) using image analysis phase and image processing phase. AR filters include, 3D animation, background changes, touching up, virtual makeup. To create these technologies, effect renderers, that use augmented reality to create these 3D effects on the face. My week 2 aesthetic, is about Tim Burton. Tim Burton’s aesthetic usually uses darker colours, sullen faces, gothic themes, and elements, and has a sort of claymation style and dull effect, by using Web-Cam filters/AR Filters, i would be able to manipulate the face and the surrounding area to reflect Tim Burtons dark aesthetic. </p>
