				<h2> MY COURSE </h2>
				<p>I chose product design and multimedia as my cross-concentrations. My goal is to be open minded and to build verbal and visual mental representations of what was presented. This also lead me to choose multimedia because it's used in various areas of work such as entertainment, advertising, publishing, digital media, gaming, motion graphics and the list goes on. This gives me many options to choose a specialization as my career path .</p>

				<ul>
				<li>My biggest fear in this course is coding ;but hopefully I will get the hang of it soon. </li>
				<li>I have an interest in graphic design and would like to explore through it furthermore.</li>
				<li>One 'big idea' ,I want to master and explore <em>Interactive 3D Multimedia content</em>.</li>

			</ul>

				<h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
				<p>I think ,I have an accepting and balanced relationship with technology i.e. if given a solid base ,I can work and build on it. I also can dedicate myself to self teach but I might get exhausted and bored of it comparitively quicker. </p>
