		<h1> MICHELLE OBAMA !</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="box2">
		<li>She was determined at an early age.</li>
				<p>Michelle got one wrong answer in a kindergarten colour quiz, she obsessed about it, unable to sleep whilst lying in bed surrounded by stuffed animals: ‘The embarrassment felt like a weight,’ she remembers, ‘like something I’d never shake off’. The next morning she immediately asked her teacher for a do-over and aced it in one go.<em> ‘I like to imagine Mrs. Burroughs was impressed with this little black girl who’d found the courage to advocate for herself,’</em> she says.</p>
				
				<li>She was told she wouldn't get into Princeton.</li>
				<p>A young Michelle Obama was told by her guidance-counsellor that they weren’t sure she was<em> “Princeton material”</em>, her first choice for college. Whilst most teenagers would have been crushed, she was once again determined, changing her tactics and seeking a recommendation letter from her assistant principal instead. <em>‘I wasn’t going to let one person’s opinion dislodge everything I knew about myself,’</em> she recalls. Instead, she wrote one killer admission essay and was accepted.</p>
				
				<li>She once took her baby along to a job interview.</li>
				<p>After deciding to go back to work after the birth of her daughter Sasha, Michelle Obama attended a job interview for an Executive Director role at a local hospital and, unable to find last-minute childcare, arrived with the three-month-old in tow. As she remembers,<em>‘She was a fact of my life. Here is me, I was saying, and here also is my baby’</em> . She would go on to get the job but to her, that wasn’t the point, as she recalls: <em>‘no matter how it panned out, I knew I’d at least done something good for myself in speaking up about my needs’.</em></p>

		<h1> MY COURSE </h1>
	    <br>
		<br>
		
			<p>I chose product design and multimedia as my cross-concentrations. My goal is to be open minded and to build verbal and visual mental representations of what was presented. This also lead me to choose multimedia because it's used in various areas of work such as entertainment, advertising, publishing, digital media, gaming, motion graphics and the list goes on. This gives me many options to choose a specialization as my career path .</p>

				<ul>
				<li>My biggest fear in this course is coding ;but hopefully I will get the hang of it soon. </li>
				<li>I have an interest in graphic design and would like to explore through it furthermore.</li>
				<li>One 'big idea' ,I want to master and explore <em>Interactive 3D Multimedia content</em>.</li>

			</ul>
		
				<p>I think ,I have an accepting and balanced relationship with technology i.e. if given a solid base ,I can work and build on it. I also can dedicate myself to self teach but I might get exhausted and bored of it comparitively quicker. </p>
