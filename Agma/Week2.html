		<p>Hyperrealism is as yet viewed as moderately new. At the point when it was first considered and created in the twentieth century, a lot of hyperrealistic workmanship included customary apparatuses of artmaking. In particular, earth, painting, charcoal, and so forth. </p>

        <p>I personally am inclined to this aesthetic as I am a devoted follower of hyperrealism; I do quite a lot of realistic artwork-definitely not as realistic as the great famous artists out there. I, personally hold it close to my heart as it was a habit I came up with during, one of the worst phases of my life and how it helped me keep myself sane. Even though I started it off as a tribute for someone, sooner or later I started enjoying it as much as the person who introduced it to me loved it. I have faint memories of being to various museums and enjoying the artwork with my dad, as a kid.Down below is a few of the realistic paintings I did.</p>

        <p>Colors psychologically affect our state of mind as individuals. The color red invokes sentiments of adoration or fervor, dark colors can summon sentiments of despondency or dread, and so forth. When it comes to art, the way we perceive color and are affected by it emotionally can impact the way we consume and enjoy art.</p>

		<p>This week we explored the power of iteration in computer graphics. We manipulated an example code to create an application that draws 10,000 lines. This was an opportunity to explore p5.js and practice working with functions, loops and objects. We had to create at least one drawing every day this week. The time that should be spent on each drawing varied from 30-40 minutes.</p>
