				<li>She was determined at an early age.</li>
				<p>Michelle got one wrong answer in a kindergarten colour quiz, she obsessed about it, unable to sleep whilst lying in bed surrounded by stuffed animals: ‘The embarrassment felt like a weight,’ she remembers, ‘like something I’d never shake off’. The next morning she immediately asked her teacher for a do-over and aced it in one go.<em> ‘I like to imagine Mrs. Burroughs was impressed with this little black girl who’d found the courage to advocate for herself,’</em> she says.</p>
				
				<li>She was told she wouldn't get into Princeton.</li>
				<p>A young Michelle Obama was told by her guidance-counsellor that they weren’t sure she was<em> “Princeton material”</em>, her first choice for college. Whilst most teenagers would have been crushed, she was once again determined, changing her tactics and seeking a recommendation letter from her assistant principal instead. <em>‘I wasn’t going to let one person’s opinion dislodge everything I knew about myself,’</em> she recalls. Instead, she wrote one killer admission essay and was accepted.</p>
				
				<li>She once took her baby along to a job interview.</li>
				<p>After deciding to go back to work after the birth of her daughter Sasha, Michelle Obama attended a job interview for an Executive Director role at a local hospital and, unable to find last-minute childcare, arrived with the three-month-old in tow. As she remembers,<em>‘She was a fact of my life. Here is me, I was saying, and here also is my baby’</em> . She would go on to get the job but to her, that wasn’t the point, as she recalls: <em>‘no matter how it panned out, I knew I’d at least done something good for myself in speaking up about my needs’.</em></p>
