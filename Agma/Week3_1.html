			<h1>WEEK 3!</h1>
			<p>I had to choose one or combine two, of the following emergent media that I wanted to focus on for your project.</p>
  					<br>
  					<li>Interactive Drawing Machine</li>
  					<li>Software Clocks</li>
  					<li>Web-Cam Filters</li>
  					<li>Generative Poetry</li>
  					<li>Music Visualizer</li>

		<h2><mark>Interactive Drawing Machine</mark></h2>
		<br>
		<p>Desmond Paul Henry (1921â€“2004) was a Manchester University Lecturer and Reader in Philosophy. He was one of the first British artists to experiment with machine-generated visual effects at the time of the emerging global computer art movement of the 1960s. During this period, Henry constructed a succession of three drawing machines from modified bombsight analog computers which were employed in World War II bombers to calculate the accurate release of bombs onto their targets.</p>

  					<p>During the 1970s Henry focussed on further developing his own unique photo-chemical techniques for the production of original visual effects. He went on to make a fourth and a fifth drawing machine in 1984 and 2002 respectively. These later machines, however, were based on a mechanical pendulum design and not bombsight computers.</p>

  					<p><mark>The main players of this field are:</mark></p>
  					<li>Alan Kaprow</li>
  					<li>Rirkrit Tiravanija</li>
  					<li>Ernesto Neto</li>
  					<li>Carsten Holler</li>
  					<li>Ann Hamilton, etc</li>

  					<p><mark>Technical developments that enable Interactive Art using technology are:</mark></p>
  					<li>Digital Manipulation</li>
  					<li>Animation</li>
  					<li>Design Digitally to Create Traditionally</li>
  					<li>Digital drawing</li>
  					<li>3-D pens and printing</li>
  					<li>Coding.</li>

		<h2>Introduction to Software clocks</h2>
		<br>
		<p>There are 2 clocks in a computer. One is a hardware clock known as the <li>Real Time Clock</li> and the other is <li>Software Clock.</li></p>
        <p>Real Time Clock is battery backup power clocks so that it tracks the time even while the computer is turned off, or in low How Computer Clocks work.</p>
        
        <p>System Clock is maintained by the kernel of an operating system and is used to set the tasks and processes - their synchronization and scheduling, settings and managing interrupts, setting timer etc. The system clock reports seconds and microseconds since a start point from the system boot up procedure. Basically the system clock is digital signal emitter, which emits signal composed of high (1) and low (0), because all the machines and their processes understand the language of binary.</p>
  					
  					<p>This is one of my favourite examples- ClockClock by Humans since 1982. I have also added a few examples by John Maeda.</p>

		<h2>DAILY PRACTICE</h2>
        <p>Every day we had to code a new p5 sketch related to your P1 proposal. This is an opportunity to explore p5.js and practice working with objects and animation.This week we worked on Software clocks.</p>
