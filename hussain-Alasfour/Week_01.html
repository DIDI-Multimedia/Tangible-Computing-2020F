		<p> 
			My goals for studying in Tangible Computing are to be diverse in writing code for different purposes. For example, I would be able to write code for microcontrollers or motherboards ( hardware code). I also would advertise a product on a website that I wrote the code for that would have the product available for everyone. Different people would get what they desire from the product instead of viewing a product from a single aspect like the hardware, code, or aesthetics. I could use the skills that I will acquire to have all these elements presented in one space.
		   Furthermore, I would like to explore how we can make a platform that offers more customizations for websites without paying a premium for making your website exceptional. There are templates that the user is stuck using if they don't know how to code. I am not saying that the designer who spends their time creating customizable websites is wrong for making people premium because their work will be exceptional. Still, the platforms that offer customizable website should not claim that the website they offer are customizable while restricting the individuals that cannot code to the templates they set. 
		   My biggest fear in this course is not being to uphold the standers that are set by the course.
