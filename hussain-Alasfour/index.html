		<h1> MuW201 Tangible Computing </h1>

		<hr>

		<h2> Hussain Alasfour</h3>
	
		<p> Hello, my name is Hussain Alasfour. I am from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and I am in the second year of college, specifically currently studying Product and multimedia design at the Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation. 
			This website is dedicated to showing my progress in the Tangible Computing course, a multimedia workshop course.
			 I like coding even though I feel that sometimes I struggle, but there is nothing better than writing code and see the work you have done take shape in front of you.
			  My goal from studying in this course is to grasp a strong foothold in coding using different coding languages. 
			  Furthermore, my ultimate goal of studying Product and Multimedia design is how we can use more technology to make our life more comfortable but also that we would not cross any moral lines, where we would have the optimal amount of technology that we would use and still be ethical about it.
