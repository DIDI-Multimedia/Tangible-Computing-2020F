            <p>8-Bit is an aesthetic inspired by old school videogames. It consists of simple pixel drawings often with very bright, vibrant colors. Technically, when referring to videogames, 8-Bit just means that the game is made up of 256 places to store information. Games like Super Mario, flappy bird and packman are all examples of 8-Bit games. However an 8-Bit aesthetic is inspired by the games but is totally different. The color palette is very unique as the colors mostly used are; purple, pink and blue. I chose this aesthetic because the dominant colors happen to be my favorite colors and the colors that I use the most. My personal aesthetic is kind of similar, I like vibrant contrasting colors. The simplicity of the aesthetic also attracted my attention to it because I like how it’s simple yet doesn’t lack anything, like it’s not complex but you understand immediately what’s going on. In my research I have also found that the 8-Bit aesthetic is kind of similar to the vaporwave aesthetic. Vaporwave uses similar colors and has this digital electronic vibe to it. It is more complex and not restrained by the number of pixels, it is used a lot in relation to electronic music. 8-Bit aesthetic is different because the images are a lot less complex and are made up of less pixels.
