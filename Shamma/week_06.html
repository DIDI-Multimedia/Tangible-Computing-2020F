The most surprising thing I’ve learnt in this course so far is the fact that anything is possible when you try. In the beginning of this course I was very worried about the projects as I know that coding is the one thing I find the most difficult. In the beginning I couldn't even imagine creating something using code, let alone something that I’ve sketched out but after project 1, I can say that I am very happy with what I’ve learnt so far. One reason I believe I was able to achieve what I wanted is because throughout the weeks we learnt many different aspects of coding focusing on one topic each week, this really helped me know what were my interests and abilities. Another reason that I believe is a factor in me being able to achieve my goals is that the project was based on my interest and working on a topic that I enjoy motivates me to reach my goal even if it may be more difficult for me. I also learnt a lot during our code kitchen sessions and they were one aspect of the course that really helped my concept come into reality. Moving forward I would like to take the feedback I got of refining the idea and code to take it a step further using emotion sensing or augmented reality. I will also begin brainstorming different ideas through sketches and researching more about augmented reality and emotion sensing to get a better understanding of these technologies. I believe one thing that is blocking me from achieving my goal in this course is that it takes time for me to learn new things, therefore I always struggle in the beginning learning the different technologies and usually have less time for the execution of the project.

<h2> API RESEARCH </h2>

I have chosen to look into Affectiva emotion sensing as well as AR.js for the future development of my project. My idea is to maybe incorporate human emotion into the maze game so that the maze alters based on emotions, positive emotions makes the maze easier while negative emotion makes the game harder in order to teach children about positive and negative emotions and to encourage positive emotions, another idea would be using augmented reality to have children create their own mazes with markers. While researching both Affectiva and AR.js, I found that AR.js had more information and tutorials which made is easier for me to see the possibilities of using it with my project while Affectiva had very little information and it was hard for me to see the technical side of how to use it which made it a bit more difficult of imagining the possibilities of using it to develop my project further.					                                </font>
