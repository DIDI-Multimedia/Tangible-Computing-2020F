			Pac-Man is an iconic maze chase arcade game that was developed by the Japanese arcade manufacturer Namco Limited in 1980. Although this game was developed in 1980 it is still widely played and is a staple game in every arcade. For project 1 I choose to look into the aesthetic of Pac-man and explore it’s visual and dynamic elements. Pac-Man is known for its very simple and geometric look, the game consists of mainly lines and dots placed in a enclosed structure.
The game is also known for it’s dark and glowing visual style as well as its bright characters. 
Because Pac-Man was developed in 1980 the visuals of the game look very pixelated and the movements of the characters are not smooth, over the years Pac-Man did not change this and it has become part of the visual and dynamic elements of the game. I choose the Pac-Man aesthetic as I enjoy creating something interesting from very simple geometric shapes and patters and the game Pac-Man does just that successfully. Although many games from the era of Pac-man are simple, It is easy to distinguish what visual elements belong to the Pac-Man aesthetic as it remained the same over the years and has very specific colors, patters and characters.
