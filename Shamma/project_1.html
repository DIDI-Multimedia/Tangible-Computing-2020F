					                                For project 1, I decided to choose pac-man as my aesthetic and combine webcam filters and time as my media formats to create a maze game. My aim for this project was to create a game that has visual and dynamic elements of pac-man along with my media formats to create an entirely new game. “Move your way out” is a maze game that uses a webcam filter to generate a maze based on your movements. The goal of the game is to try to complete the maze from start to finish without touching any outside space in a specific amount of time. Using your body as a guide, you can alter the shape of the maze in order to help you get to the end. This game is aimed to help develop visual perception, hand -eye coordination and cognitive function. For my research, I decided to look into how maze games such as pac-man can have positive effects on children’s development and can help children learn valuable skills such as being quick and sharp when making decisions and having patience when completing difficult tasks. 
Maze games have been shown to help children in many ways, It boosts their problem solving skills, improve hand-eye coordination, improves visual perception and help with cognitive process (Drummond, 2016). 
One research that analyzed children’s decision making speed found that children who played the game pac-man before answering a set of questions had quick decision making speed as well as better concentration. (Pacman Game Benefit Analysis on Decision Making Speed, 2014)
During the start of the project, I began by sketching out the ideas I had for this game to try to understand how I could bring it to life. My initial sketch and concept was to have a maze that is a countdown timer at the same time but after some experimentations and iterations, I found that the concept made the game confusing for the player and does not follow pac-man’s aesthetic of simple geometric shapes and patters. After refining and finalizing my concept and sketches I began Iterating on open processing. My first iterations on open processing helped me understand how webcams work and how I could create a webcam filter that would act as a maze. I assigned 2 different colors to different levels of darkness and brightness of the pixels and changed the shape to a square to try to recreate the vision I had sketched out. I added an if function that displays the words “game over” and makes a sound every time the curser moves to the yellow and black colors in an attempt to gamify what I had so far. After play testing with my family members, I got feedback that would help me improve the game. I decided to only focus on one color for the maze to make the game simpler and added a countdown as well as a starting point and ending point that would help the player understand the game more. After iterating and play testing once again I was satisfied with my final results for the game.
My future plan for this project is to try to incorporate real life elements and combine physical with digital through VR or augmented reality to create an entirely experience for the player. I would also like to look more into how I could create something that is not only a fun experience but is beneficial for children and helps with their development.
