		<h2> Breathwork </h2>
		
		<p> Breathing, it’s something we don't normally think about in our day to day lives, just like we don't think about blinking or digesting our food, typically these are things done autonomously through our autonomic nervous system. Although these things are done autonomously, breathing is different, as we can manipulate our breathing intentionally to get desired results. Certain patterns of breathing can evoke different feelings enterally and can have a profound effect on the mind, body and soul, this is something known as breath-work.
Breath-work is described as the manipulation of your breathing rate and depth. Changing the pattern of your breathing can change the way you feel, some breathing patterns can give you clarity while others enhance your awareness and focus, some may relaxation and even put you in a meditative state. breath-work teaches you how to manipulate the breath in order to achieve your desired results. In a fast paced world, usually filled with stress and anxiety most of us don't think of making time during the day to properly breathe, we usually take short, shallow breaths, breathing from our chest rather than our belly.  because of our constant state of stress, we shallow breath which it sets of the sympathetic nervous system that is responsible for our body’s fight or flight response, therefore we remain in a vicious cycle of stress. 
Breath work calms the nervous system and switches your body from a state of fight or flight to rest and digest as it activates your parasympathetic nervous system. 
Because breath-work calms down our nervous system, it has many profound effects on the body, it lowers stress, relaxes muscles and highly oxygenates our body, which makes it harder for viruses and bacteria to live in the body. Having a daily breath work practice is something that every person should incorporate into their routine,  Breath-work can be a powerful tool that has many benefits, is free and can be used in order to achieve balance and stillness in a chaotic world. . </p>
