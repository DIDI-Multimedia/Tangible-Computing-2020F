   <h2> Project 1 Research - Aesthetic Choice </h2>
   <hr>
   
   <br>
   <h3>
     My choice of aesthetic is a combination of pen plotter, cyberpunk and Vapor-wave. It involves repetitive as well as abstract lines which have a subtle glow underneath them.<br>
    <br>
      I chose this aesthetic because I have always been intrigued by the idea of repeated lines creating a pattern while also creating an illusion when their paths are modified and/or simulated. The glow underneath the lines represents a new development in my interests. I have been exploring a neon aesthetic for a few months now and have been trying to absorb parts of it into my personal work. (animations).<br>
<br>
<br>
        Visual Elements:  <br>
            1.  Repetitive Shapes.<br>
            2.  Hatched Patterns.<br>
            3.  Illusive alignment of designs.<br>
            4.  Subtle Glow under different elements. (eg. Background of this page)<br>
            5.  Overall dark and black background.<br>
            6.  Text constricted to center of the page.<br>
            7.  Not more than one kind of design on a particular page, very minimalistic approach. <br>
            8.  Vibrant colors depending on content. <br>
            9.  Very Basic shapes such as points, circles, lines, rectangles.<br>
            10. Gives feeling of being fresh and alive. <br>
<br>
<br>
        Interaction Dynamics:<br>
            1.  Points creating ripple effect.( For e.g. The<a href="1.WeekOne.html"><span style="color: #03fc0b"> week one page</span> </a>)<br>
            2.  Lines inducing a feeling of movement and warp through time. <br>
            3.  Each Page changing itâ€™s background animation to create a separate vibe.<br>
            4.  Glowing.<br>
            5.  Motion.<br>
