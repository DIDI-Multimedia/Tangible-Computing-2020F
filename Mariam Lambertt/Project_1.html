<h6 style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 60px">Low poly</h6>


<br>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Low poly art is a 3D mesh that has a relatively low number of polygons.
It simplifies the shape of the 3D object to a point when it is still recognizable.
This art, despite appearing of low aesthetic quality, its purpose was to resemble reality. It is not a descriptive illustration, but a simulative one. It lacks surreal outlines and attitudes.</p>

				I chose this example because I am fascinated with Blender, a 3D modeling software that allows you to easily create any kind of object, effect, or environment, including the low poly technique. Also, this method is visually curious.</p> 
			 	<p>At first, it looks like origami and makes one wonder at the level of detail in a larger environment like the one that can be seen in the video (available if you click on the photo) to the right. It seems to be a whole world of paper, although, in reality, it is an arduous effort of modeling in a low mesh.</p>
				<p>This technique is more time saving and graphically simple, in terms that it is easier to render and produce. This fact gives it many points in favor as many artists and platforms declare Low Poly as their style. Among the best-known examples are the Unity3D platform, Blender, and many audiovisual productions. Part of the reason for choosing this as the style of something is also that it appears to be very detailed work, and it is not so much. </p>

					<h4>Mariam Lambertt</h4>
					<p>I am a student at Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation. My preferences in design go around Product and Multimedia, because I would like to know how to combine those concentrations and make a useful, meaningful, and durable design.</p>
					<p>My main motivation with Multimedia courses is, in general, to learn graphic visualization techniques. I want to be able to convey meaningful messages through beautiful graphics. I love VFX, animations, 3D modeling for cinematic purposes, and I intend to specialize in some terms related to that. I am also open to change the course of my life while discovering new things in my time at DIDI.</p>
						<p>I am quite positive, and this is my means to reach the end.. </p>
