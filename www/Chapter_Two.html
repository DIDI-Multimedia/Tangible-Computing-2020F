<!-- 
        Time Perception is a scientific field exploring how the human perception of time is malleable,  subjective, and changing based on circumstances and our psychological state. It is no surprise, that the perception of time is also a fundamental consideration for the design of digital interactions and experiences. In this open-ended project, you are asked to create an time-keeping device which facilitates a novel experience for a user regarding the passage of time.
