      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.maximiliankiener.com/digitalprojects/time/">Do you feel that time seems to be going by faster as you get older?</a></p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-science-of-time-perception-how-to-make-your-days-longer">Can you remember a period in your life where time seemed to stretch on forever?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Time Perception is a scientific field exploring how the human perception of time is malleable,  subjective, and changing based on circumstances and our psychological state. It is no surprise, that the perception of time is also a fundamental consideration for the design of digital interactions and experiences.</p>
        <p>In this open-ended project, you are asked to create an time-based media piece which facilitates a novel experience for a user regarding the passage of time. </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p> As design and art jump into the digital domain, a variety of new media forms have emerged. </p>
        <p> In this course, we explore some of these possibilities.<p/>
          <p> In this first phase, we will explore a different topic each week. They are:  </p>
          <ul>
            
            <li> 02 <b> Interactive Drawing Machine </b> </li>
            <li> 03 <b> Software Clocks </b> </li>
            <li> 04 <b> Web-Cam Filters </b> </li>
            <li> 05 <b> Generative Poetry </b> </li>
            <li> 06 <b> Music Visualizer </b> </li>

          </ul>
          
          <p> In this project, you will take  </p>

          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <ul>
            
            <li> You must use JavaScript for at least part of project</li>
            <li> This is due in session 8, October 21st </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
          <p> 30% of Final Grade </p>
          <li> Conceptual rigor (25%)</li>
          <li> Application of appropriate technologies and methods (25%) </li>
          <li> Experimentation, risk-taking (25%) </li>
          <li> Effort, consistency, and participation(25%) </li>
          <p>
            
            Note: You must use of third-party examples as a guideline only. It is easy to identify copy + pasted solutions - the highest mark possible in these cases is 50%. Seek out extra help if you are facing technical challenges.Late Policy: 1 minute late = 50% penalty
            
          </p>
          <h2> Deliverables </h2>
          <li> Submit on moodle and posted on personal webside </li>
          <li> 500 word, update description of project citing relevant data and academic sources </li>
          <li> Documentation of process, including code, sketches, inspiration images </li>
          <li> Short video capture (60 seconds) of solution - you can post to youtube to embed on this website </li>
          <li> Create links to the 5-10 best daily experiments which contribute to P1 (you can use this to explain your project)</li>
          <li> For moodle submission name, create a zip folder which contains all of this content using the folloing convention 'p1-lastname-firstname'</li>
          <!-- <li> Use of appropriate technologies to formulate design solution </li> -->
