    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> 
      <a href="https://www.maximiliankiener.com/digitalprojects/time/">Do you feel that time seems to be going by faster as you get older?</a></p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-science-of-time-perception-how-to-make-your-days-longer">Can you remember a period in your life where time seemed to stretch on forever?</a>
      </p>

      <p>

        Time Perception is a scientific field exploring how the human perception of time is malleable,  subjective, and changing based on circumstances and our psychological state. It is no surprise, that the perception of time is also a fundamental consideration for the design of digital interactions and experiences. In this open-ended project, you are asked to create an time-keeping device which facilitates a novel experience for a user regarding the passage of time.

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <ul>
      
      <li> You must use JavaScript for at least part of project</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

    <p> 30% of Final Grade </p>

      <li> Conceptual rigor (25%)</li>
      <li> Application of appropriate technologies and methods (25%) </li>
      <li> Experimentation, risk-taking (25%) </li>
      <li> Effort, consistency, and participation(25%) </li>


    <p> 
    
    Note: You must use of third-party examples as a guideline only. It is easy to identify copy + pasted solutions - the highest mark possible in these cases is 50%. Seek out extra help if you are facing technical challenges.Late Policy: 1 minute late = 50% penalty 
    
    </p>
