		<div >
<h2>  Hello and welcome to my workshop website, I have dedicated this site to the sharing my ideas, my interests and the work that I do in this class. One of the most beautiful things I find about humans is the way that they can share different ideas through many forms of expression, and what I have always admired about multimedia is this aspect of sharing knowledge and information in new and exciting ways, whenever I look at raw data, all the numbers and letters merge into indistinguishable forms, and often it can be daunting to sort through it, but then looking at the same data though visuals makes it beautiful and understandable to me, and this reflects the power of multimedia, there is so much information out there in the world, and most of it is difficult to understand, which renders it useless, what is the point of having useful information if it doesnâ€™t get used? information is only good when it reaches the minds and hearts of people, and the usage of visuals audio and text can be so useful to send out a powerful message to the world, which brings me to how I see myself using multimedia in the future, my goal create interactive interfaces that might help children learn better in schools. <a href="www.didi.ac.ae" > more to come! <a >  </p>   </h2> </a> </div>
