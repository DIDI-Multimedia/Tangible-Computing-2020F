		<h2> The message that resonates with me the most is from the album titled “Be the cowboy”
When asked what the name of the title means she responded by talking about her experience as an Asian woman, saying that she feels the need to apologize just for walking into a room. 
She used the phrase “be the cowboy” as a mantra to herself. 
The cowboy is a symbol for a soaring spirit, an icon of self-reliance, arrogance, and independence, it is disruptive, unapologetic, and most importantly, free. this mantra is an important one to have because, in times of uncertainty and insecurity, we all need to remind ourselves every once in a while, to be the cowboy.<h2> <div></div>
